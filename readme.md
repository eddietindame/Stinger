# Stinger 🐝

A cross-platform mobile app built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## What is Stinger?

I envision Stinger to be a complete social experience based around the tea round.

## Why is it called Stinger...?

In cockney rhyming slang Stinging nettle = kettle.

"Put the stinger on!"

## Just... why?

Look, coming up with really good app ideas ain't easy... Also I think the idea has some potential.
